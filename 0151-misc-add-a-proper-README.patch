+# LJRV - LuaJIT RISC-V 64 Port
+
+LuaJIT is a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for the Lua programming language,
+RISC-V is a free and open ISA enabling a new era of processor innovation.
+
+## Introduction
+
+LJRV is a ongoing porting project of LuaJIT to the RISC-V 64-bit architecture by PLCT Lab, ISCAS.
+The ultimate goal is to provide a RISC-V 64 LuaJIT implementation and have it upstreamed to the official LuaJIT repository.
+
+## Progress
+
+- [x] Interpreter Runtime
+  - except unwinding
+- [x] JIT Compiler
+  - table reference might be broken
+
+LJRV is still of beta quality, particularly the JIT compiler.
+For production usage, we suggests disable the JIT compiler during compilation by setting `XCFLAGS+= -DLUAJIT_DISABLE_JIT` in Makefile or environment variable.
+
+## Bug Report
+
+Please report bugs to [Issues](https://github.com/infiWang/LuaJIT-RV/issues).
